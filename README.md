Mini AI Tool is a web based application which provides the services like Optical character 
recognition and Youtube video downloader. In the running world, there is growing demand for the 
software systems to recognize characters in computer system when information is scanned through 
paper documents as we know that we have number of newspapers and books which are in printed 
format related to different subjects, these days there is a huge demand in “storing the
information available in these paper documents in to a computer storage disk and then later reusing 
this information by searching process”. One simple way to store information in these paper
documents in to computer system is to first scan the documents and then store them as
IMAGES. But to reuse this information itis very difficult to read the individual contents ‘and 
searching the contents form these documents line-by-line and word-by-word. The reason for this 
difficulty is the font characteristics of the characters in paper documents are different to font of the 
characters in computer system. As a result, computer is unable to recognize the characters while 
reading them. This concept of storing the contents of paper documents in computer storage place 
and then reading and searching the content is called DOCUMENT PROCESSING. Sometimes in 
this document processing we need to process the information that is related to Languages other 
than the English in the world. For this document processing we need a software system called 
CHARACTER RECOGNITION SYSTEM. This process is also called DOCUMENT IMAGE 
ANALYSIS (DIA),
Thus our need is to develop character recognition software system to perform Document Image 
Analysis which transforms documents in paper format to electronic format, for this process there 
are various techniques in the world, among all those techniques we have chosen Optical Character 
Recognition as main fundamental technique to recognize characters. The conversion of paper 
documents in to electronic format is an on-going task in many of the organizations particularly in 
Research and Development (R&D) area, in large business enterprises, in government institutions, 
so on, from our problem statement we can introduce the necessity of Optical Character Recognition 
in mobile electronic devices such as cell phones, digital cameras to acquire images and recognize 
them as a part ‘of face recognition and validation. To effectively use Optical Character Recognition 
for character recognition in-order to perform Document Image Analysis (DIA), we are using the 
information in Grid format ‘This system is thus effective and useful in Virtual Digital Library's
design and construction.
